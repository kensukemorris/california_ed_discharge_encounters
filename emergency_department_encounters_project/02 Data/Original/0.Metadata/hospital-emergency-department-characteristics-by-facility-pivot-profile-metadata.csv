Description,"This dataset contains annual Excel pivot tables that display summaries of the patients treated in each Emergency Department (ED).  The Emergency Department data is sourced from two databases, the ED Treat-and-Release Database and the Inpatient Database (i.e. patients treated in the ED and then formally admitted to the hospital).  The summary data include number of visits, expected payer, discharge disposition, age groups, sex, preferred language spoken, race groups, principal diagnosis groups, and principal external cause of injury/morbidity groups.  The data can also be summarized statewide or for a specific hospital county, ED service level, teaching/rural status, and/or type of control."
